# Transcript Sorter

A simple transcript sorting application based on the boilerplate set up by Maxime Gris.


git clone https://github.com/maximegris/angular-electron.git


This application will receive .srt file produced by substitleEdit and display an entry at a time where the user can add keywords on the fly and assign to each line. 

Keyword seach results will show all entries that have been tagged with the keyword in the whole file. Progress is saved into a text file that stores the data in json format.
